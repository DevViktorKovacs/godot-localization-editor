# godot-localization-editor
## Summary
This project is part of the [ALAN13-feature-pack](https://github.com/DevViktorKovacs/ALAN13-feature-pack), which meant to help Godot developers to kickstart their Game development in C#.
This particular repository however works as a standalone developer tool you can use to handle localization files for Godot projects.
## Features
* GUI to edit localization csv files
* Option to add new languages
* Integration to the API of the most advanced translator A.I [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) 
## Using A.I. translation
**Disclaimer:** A.I. translation regardless how advanced is not meant to be used to produce the definite, final versions of texts. Human supervision and proofreading is still required for adequate quality. It's recommended to aproach it merely as rough first draft.   
* For using the translation features, you need an account on [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com). Once you set up your account, you can access you API key to fill out the API field on the GUI. The free tier account comes with 500 000 characters per month, which should be more than enough for a not too text heavy game. 
* If you intend to further develop this tool to better fit your needs, I recommend setting up a mock server for the DeepL integration, so you can avoid burning your credit during development and testing. You can find the required repo [here](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mock).
